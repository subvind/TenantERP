  <div class="description black-text">What makes an idea ready? Perhaps a few things. Does it have critical infrastructure or software that must be deployed and updated regularly? Does it have a single repository where the source code to that software may be looked at? Does it have tests? Does it have a status page? Does it have a deployment pipeline? Does it have a kanban board with swim lanes for pending, in development, testing, released, etc? When it goes down is someone alerted?</div>
