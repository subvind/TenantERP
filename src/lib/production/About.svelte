  <div class="description black-text">What makes an idea live? Perhaps a few things. Does it have a society backed by culture that expresses ideal ways of living and life? Does it have a manifesto that reinforces that stated culture? Does it have a vision, target, and strategy for achieving that manifesto? Does it have a set of pricipals defined as core values that can be used to spark joy into new or existing projects? Does it have a current status and ways for others to contribute? When it is streaming are it's movements predictable?</div>
