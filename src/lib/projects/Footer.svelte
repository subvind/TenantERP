  <div class="description black-text">What makes an idea difficult? Perhaps a few things. Does it have a feature in it that has never been done before? Does it have a requirement in it that is just too big of a scale in too little of a timeframe; for example, 1 person must move 1 trillion rocks 1,000 miles in 1 hour? Does it require advanced skills and experiece to the point where the project becomes over budget? Does it have a high Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)?</div>
