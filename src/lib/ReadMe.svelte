              Hello There!
              <br />My name is Travis. I am a full stack developer. This collection of websites and apps all under the anchor logo and isTrav branding are for learning, innovating, and progressing. Take a look at our <a href="/about">istrav.com/about</a> page for more on our philosphy, ideals and pricipals.
            </span>
            <br /><br />This website, <a href="//istrav.com">isTrav</a> runs 100% cloud/serverless using CloudFlare's wrangler repository with their KV database and it's frontend is served by Vercel. So it has amazing uptime, expensive, and less likely to have code rot.
            <br /><br />My platform, <a href="//istrav.net" target="_blank">/istrav/</a> runs 100% on the server and can deploy to Heroku or Kubernetes. It is fully customizable and white-labeled so any developer may fork it. It has a Fair Source 25 (v0.9) license so it's free up until you have 25 active users.
            <br /><br />Your platform, <a href="#!">/mybrand/</a> runs just like my platform except you have complete access to run it as you wish for as long as you follow the license agreement.
            <br /><br />The <a href="/client-area">istrav.com/client-area</a>, is where you get to track and manage the progress of your ideas and their platforms. See <a href="/pricing">istrav.com/pricing</a> for developer limits on software usage. Thank you for your support.

            Innovation Management Software (IMS)
          </div>
          as a Service (SaaS) is a system for managing ideas (a thought or suggestion as to a possible course of action.) that we provide as a service to our clients; with an IMS strategy an idea's full life cycle may be tracked from creation to taking action and turning it into a reality. Our client area allows idea founders or product owners to put their ideas on platforms which are backed by a bulletin board system where users can multi-layer network with one another and share content and other messages/files all in relation to the founder's idea.
          <br /><br />isTrav is like the system's hub for companies, businesses, or other groups to build and manage their ideas; innovation is our priority.
