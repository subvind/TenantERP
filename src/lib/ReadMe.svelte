            Hello There!
          </div>
          Thank you for taking the time in reviewing us for your consideration.

          Websites are like sail boats. They require a main haul or backend API. They require a main mast or frontend interface. When put together and under the right wind-conditions/user-interations your boat/project can successfully navigate to it's destination.

          Say hello to underwind.solutions: where your project is not just another website; because we treat your project as if it were a high end yacht. We're not as expensive as you might think though, as we only charge per request. So no wind-under-you-sails/user-interactions then no movement/charge.
          <br />
          <br />
          Therefore, the better user experience we create, the more user-interactions your website will get, thus the more profit we can both make. 
          <br />

          kind regards,

          The suffix "-nomy" is derived from the Greek word "nomos," which means "law," "custom," or "management." When added to the end of a word, it forms nouns that typically refer to a system, science, or study of a particular subject or field. These words are often used to describe the principles, rules, or governance of that subject.
