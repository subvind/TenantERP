              Hello There!
              <br />My name is Travis. I am a full stack developer. This collection of websites and apps that are all under the anchor logo and isTrav branding are for research, learning, and exploring purposes. Take a look at our <a href="/about">istrav.com/about</a> page for more point-of-reference and philosphy.
            </span>
            <br /><br />This website, <a href="//istrav.com">isTrav</a> runs 100% on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">client</span> and will deploy to any architecture. It is built from scratch on a shoe string buget. So it has amazing uptime, expensive, and less likely to have code rot.
            <br /><br />My platform, <a href="//istrav.net" target="_blank">/istrav/</a> runs 100% on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">server</span> and will deploy to any container serivce. It is fully customizable and white-labeled so others may fork it. It has a Fair Source 25 (v0.9) license so it's free up until the 25 active users limit is reached.
            <br /><br />Your platform, <a href="#!">/brandx/</a> runs just like my platform except you have complete access to run it as you wish for as long as you follow the same license agreement.
            <br /><br />The <a href="/client-area">istrav.com/client-area</a> is where members are granted access control panels. See <a href="/pricing">istrav.com/pricing</a> for advertising limits and no hidden fees. Thank you for your support!

            Innovation Management System (IMS)
          </div>
          as a Service (SaaS)... is a collection of tools for cultivating, launching, routing, and maintaining ideas (things that are thoughts or suggestions as to a possible course of action.) that we provide for our clients; with an IMS strategy an idea's full life cycle (uni or multi-seasonal) may be developed from ideation to reality with or without "the concept of zero" // Our client area allows anyone to put their ideas on platforms which are backed by a bulletin board system where anybody can align through a multi-layer network, distribute messages/files, and carry on conversations about any discussion.
          <br /><br />isTrav is a hub positioned near the center of an era where collaboration means survival; innovation is priority #1 thus downstream from that is all just matter reflecting off of energy.
