        Hello There!
        <br />My name is Travis. I am a full stack developer. This place is my personal portfolio and ground base for launching <a href="/solutions">Solutions</a> to <a href="/production">Production</a> that will install in just 1-click or chat with <a href="/my-assistant">My Assistant</a> who is an AI bot.
      </span>
      <br /><br /><i>My goal is to establish a single monolithic database or <a href="/platforms">Platform</a> that all my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> use and connect to. Like Supabase and a CMS except for applications. Which entails quite a bit of things so look further into <a href="/about">About</a> for more information on that.</i>
      <br /><br />These applications or <a href="/apps">Apps</a> are targeted for either a mobile phone, a frontend website, or a backend server. Some applications may target all or multiple devices. Because everything is multi-tenant all apps are compatible with each other under a single platform.
      <br /><br />This website, <a href="//istrav.com">isTrav</a> runs 100% cloud/serverless using CloudFlare's wrangler repository and it's frontend is served by Vercel. So it has amazing uptime, expensive, and less likely to have code rot.
      <br /><br />My platform, <a href="//communityfolder.com" target="_blank">/community_folder/</a> runs 100% on the server and can deploy to Heroku or Kubernetes. It is fully customizable and white-labeled so any developer may fork it. It has a Fair Source 25 (v0.9) license so it's free up until you have 25 active users.
      <br /><br />Your platform, <a href="#!">/for_example/</a> runs just like my <a href="/platforms">Platform</a> except you have complete access to run it as you wish for as long as you follow the license agreement.
      <br /><br /><i>My long term goal is work with OpenAI and build a bot that knows how to code and write programs. It will be able to look at a platform's mono database and know how to use it. Essentially a programmer's assistant. </i>
