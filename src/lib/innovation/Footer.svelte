  <div class="description black-text">What makes an idea above average? Perhaps a few things. Does it have a name that others can easily hear, say, and identify? Does it exist in a place that makes it special? Does it have a team behind it that is motivated? Does it have a design so good that others know it by word of mouth. Does it open up a new maket for learning or business? When it comes to the test of time will others still be using it?</div>
