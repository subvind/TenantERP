  <div class="description black-text">What makes an idea trending? Perhaps a few things. Does it have a related social media profile that has a high amount of watches, shares, stars, likes, or followers? Does it have competition with others trying to achieve the same goals? Does it have a position at the top of some leaderboard?</div>
