    GEO as in Earth/Maps or Spherical/Geometry is interesting because when it comes to programming the space time complexity problem is simple to understand yet hard to execute on.
    <br />
    <br />
    Lime moves people on scooters, Uber moves people in cars, Door Dash moves stuff in bags, Fedex moves items in packages, etc. All these services have one thing in common and it has everything todo with space and time.
    <br />
    <br />
    isTrav GEO moves scrambled information securly between 2 things over insecure channels aka the internet, radio, etc.
    <br />
    <br />
    This kind of service in the modern era is becoming ever more important escpecially around the topic of cyber warfare; where later you'll see us get into building fake data generation. Such that even if an attacker got ahold of your message they would have found it like a needle in a haystack of other needles making it that much more difficult to figure out which needle is the right needle. 
    <br />
    <br />
    As such, you will be shocked by my research in information theory. By the end "AI Bot" will have some Natural Language Processing or NLP such that it will be able to communicate and run commands within communityfolder.com (a side project that I am also working on). Where you will see me create a completely fake and fully active and communicating online community. Pictures and conversations included. Absolutely fake yet real. Cool or scarry cyber deterence that will freak out the enemy I'll let you make the decision.
    <br />
    <br />
    The math behind GEO is simple. It works like the modulus operation where computations loop back around to the beginning instead of ticking the next milage counter over. So, walk to the edge of the Earth and then you are right back to where you started. Later we'll get into how we take advantage of distributing space and compute at planitary scales. 
    <br />
    <br />
    First we keep track of the following:
    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item">
        1. The computer specs (CPU, Memory, and Space) for each thing.
      </li>
      <li class="collection-item">
        2. The geo distance between each thing.
      </li>
      <li class="collection-item">
        3. The driving distance & time between each thing.
      </li>
      <li class="collection-item">
        4. The internet ping response time between each thing.
      </li>
      <li class="collection-item">
        5. The internet connection speed between each thing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    So that the requirement for a thing to be a thing is that it has an operating system running our app, GPS, and an internet connection. So there could potentially be millions of things being tracked and possibly billions of records stored in a database over some period of time.
    <br />
    <br />
    We already track these kinds of things with politicians such as the president. Where they are monitored 24/7/365 by the secret service for just about everything from heart rate to sleeping or awake; a number and a boolean. This is the kind of service GEO will be providing for each thing.
    <br />
    <br />
    Later we will get into "Consensus" where we'll perform leader election between all of our things and then start a cron job that will execute every 1 minute a backup of all the data that we are recording between each thing.
    <br />
    <br />
    What is great about this metadata is that we may use it to our advantage. For instance, we may use it to setup the initial configuration of our Network of "Scramblers" ... then after quorum a rolling update of secrets would be impossible for code breakers to follow and crack. 
    <br />
    <br />
    This get's me at my famous 1 + 1 problem. Cosmically speaking: where it is impossible to have everything twice // computerly speaking: you only have one 1TB hard drive, you fill it up to the max, and now you want to make a backup ... so 1 + 1 = error: hard drive is already full. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Our app functions the same. Let me explain. There is a famous machine that scambled the German's messages during World War 2 called Enigma. The machine is useless by itself. However when exact copies of it were made and distributed across vast distances and then linked together over telephone wires and public radio airways using Morse code it quickly became the target of many code breakers. Anyways every 3 months central command would reissue new configuration settings for their Enigma machines and if you had obtained a copy of them you could decode the German's messages too. 
    <br />
    <br />
    The key here is that it would be impossible for code breakers to have an exact historic and latest copy of all the metadata that we'll be using to setup the initial configuration of our Network of Scramblers. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Second we calculate the following:
    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item">
        6. The scramble settings between each thing.
      </li>
      <li class="collection-item">
        7. The one time pad stream between each thing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    With a one time pad or OTP messages are XOR encoded into streams of bits, transmitted over websockets, and then the bits are XOR decoded back into messages; such that it is secure end to end. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Note: only scamblers that have access to the OTP and encoded bits may decrypt any data back into the original message.
    <br />
    <br />
    So it's very important that code breakers do not figure out how we are generating OTP. Cleverly we could use Markov "Chains" in order to generate OTP and we can also use them to generate fake network traffic so that our real scrambled messages are hidden like needles in a haystack.
    <br />
    <br />
    Suppose we have 2 or more computers or things in the same location. Because we could just have an address to a building with a bunch of computers on the inside. We'll need some sort of way to identify each and every indevidual thing.
    <br />
    <br />
    Third we identify the following:
    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item">
        0. The names called between each thing.
      </li>
    </ul>
    This could be a single word or a set of words such as someones first and last name. Notice that the thing does not have a single name ... other things have names that they use to call this thing. So it has many names. For instance a bill and an invoice are the same thing yet have different names depending on how you look at it.
