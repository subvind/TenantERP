          What does Full Stack Developer or FSD mean? Most people would probably tell you that it has something to do with the Front End and Back End of an application. As in the conversation between a client (smart phone, browser) and a server (data center). For me FSD means any source code that needs to be written or maintained; which most modern companies provide direct programming language level API's to interact with their business. This has added a lot of surface area for all FSDs to explore and code. There are many videos about this on YouTube. So Full Stack Developer could mean a lot of things. It just depends on what problems you are trying to solve and with what <a href="/solutions">Solutions</a>. In this about page I'll be talking about the area that I have explored and the path that I have taken through the land of Full Stack Development.
          <br /><br />Because FSDs need to have expertise in all of the areas where software has taken ahold of in businesses; including, internet of things (IoT), desktop, mobile, website, server, etc. therefor means not all FSDs are the same and a lot of these <a href="/solutions">Solutions</a> may be achieved in multiple ways or in different programming languages. Now, I have always been a fan of standards and consistancy so naturally I will try to write and use as much code done in JavaScript/TypeScript and node.js which are all pretty much the same language and, in my opinion as a FSD, cover the entire stack and can be used for 99% of today's Applications. I think it's best to be a master of one language here rather than a jack of all trades. Especially when that 1 language covers that much ground. So naturally JS and TS are really the only option. Check out <a href="/apps">Apps</a> for examples on what I have done. Today a lot of companies hire an entire team of people and put them into categories by job title. Then to make things complex each position speaks a different language with the computer to the point where no 1 person at the company could possibly understand the entire codebase. Not ideal. 
          <br /><br />You would be supprised how much faster one can go on a bicycle with gears/shifting and aerodynamics. The same is true with FSDs because they must jump from one role/context to another (marketer, UI/UXer, tester, developer, stager, productioner) and still be performant. A good full stack developer has experience in each area and a desktop setup that gives them more real estate than what a fronty or backy might have. For instance, I have multiple dedicated machines, and a keyboard-video-mouse switch to jump between each machine, then I leave workspaces open inside each machine for each role/context in a FSDs lifecycle. With a single 27 inch monitor and a 4 button switch that can toggle between 4 machines ... I can jump between workspaces and more space is available for other things. Start ups are in demand of FSDs because they need not hire extra people. Big companies want to hire talented FSDs so atleast 1 person can explain the entire codebase. Other companies want FSDs because when a team of like minded people get together amazing things can be achievied.
